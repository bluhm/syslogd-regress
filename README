Run syslogd regressions tests.  As only one syslogd can run per
machine, each test kills any syslogd first.  At the end the system's
syslogd gets restarted.

The test framework runs a client, and a server, and a syslogd.  The
messages are passed via the log socket from the client to syslogd.
From there udp transport is used to reach the server.  All processes
write log files where the message has to show up.
